summary: 'A native Californian, Sarah Hathaway Bixby Smith (1871-1935) was born at
  her family''s sheep ranch near San Juan Bautista, where she lived until the family
  moved to Los Angeles some six years later. Her father, Llewellyn Bixby, had left
  Maine to settle in the West in 1851, and he and his brothers became one of southern
  California''s most influential families. Adobe days (1925) is Mrs. Smith''s account
  of her early childhood on the ranch and trips east to visit relatives in Maine,
  girlhood in Los Angeles, visits to Los Cerritos and Los Alamitos ranches, and her
  education in Los Angeles public schools and at Pomona and Wellesley Colleges. She
  supplements this with the life of her father, Llewellyn Bixby: his journey to California
  via Panama and months as a prospector at the Volcano Diggings, cattle and sheep
  drives across country, and real estate investments in Los Angeles and neighboring
  counties. More generally, she discusses the role of Mexican and Chinese servants
  and other aspects of housekeeping and childrearing, sheep husbandry and the wool
  business, Los Angeles''s growth, the history of Southern California under the Spanish,
  and the evolution of Pasadena, Riverside, Anaheim, and San Bernardino.'

  a California girl on a sheep ranch and in El Pueblo de Nuestra Se√±ora de Los Angeles
  while it was yet a small and humble town; together with an account of how three
  young men from Maine in eighteen hundred and fifty-three drove sheep and cattle
  across the plains, mountains and deserts from Illinois to the Pacific coast; and
  the strange prophecy of Admiral Thatcher about San Pedro harbor'
